# Automated-Chatbot
Health-Care Chatbot using AI
Healthcare is essential to lead a good life. However, it is rather difficult to procure the
consultation with the physician for each and every well being problem. As we all know
the world is suffering from a pandemic situation right now. Our GDP gradually
decreased, as of now we have web application but with less functionality to spread
awareness of COVID-19 and to connect essential COVID-19-related health services to
the people. The thought is to create a medical chatbot (Viro-attack) using Artificial
Intelligence that may diagnose the disease and provide fundamental information about the
illness sooner than consulting a health care provider. This will lend a hand to scale back
healthcare prices and strengthen accessibility to medical knowledge thru scientific
chatbot. This Viro-attack web application helps us to get updates related to COVID-19
and it spreads awareness about Corona virus in this web application. It also provides a
vaccine related updates and current active cases in nearest locality of the user. And this
web application will be containing all the COVID-19 related information and the user can
also get their health status in the web application by entering their current symptoms if
they have any.
